  It's simple. One of the members of our team, Yeji who is the youngest girl, suggested zero-waste as the theme. :) By the way, We are not environmentalists.

"발표 4일 전, 예기치 못한 오류로 인해 만들어두었던 파일이 많은 어려움을 야기했습니다. 그러나 팀원 분들의 지원과 협력 덕분에 결국 모든 것을 엎고 다시 시작하게 되었고, 기간 안에 성공적으로 마무리할 수 있었습니다. 이런 어려움을 함께 극복하며 얻은 소중한 경험에 감사하며, 팀원들과의 협업으로 인해 더 강해진 팀의 결속력을 느낄 수 있었습니다. 감사합니다."

풀스택 웹개발자 교육을 들으며 처음으로 하게 된 팀 프로젝트입니다.
새로운 사람들과 함께하는 프로젝트라 프로젝트 일정을 듣고 굉장히 걱정하면서 설레기도 하였습니다. 좋은 결과도 중요하지만 프로젝트 과정속에서 많은 것을 배워가고 싶었습니다. 정말 감사하게도 팀원 한분한분 열정과 배려가 넘치는 분들이여서 팀 프로젝트를 하며 어려움을 겪어도 이겨낼 용기를 얻었습니다. 팀 프로젝트를 통해 좋은 인연과 따뜻한 기억을 쌓게되어서 기쁩니다.
